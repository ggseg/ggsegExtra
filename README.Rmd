This package contains information on verified atlases compatible for use in [ggseg](https://ggsegverse.github.io/ggseg) and [ggseg3d](https://ggsegverse.github.io/ggseg3d) plotting packages in R.
It also contains functions and pipelines to create custom atlases.

## Installing 

We recommend installing this package from its [r-universe](https://ggsegverse.r-universe.dev/#builds) build:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Enable this universe
options(
  repos = c(
    ggsegverse = "https://ggsegverse.r-universe.dev",
    CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"
  )
)

# Install some packages
install.packages("ggseg.extra")
```

Alternatively, install the package with the remotes package from github.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ggsegverse/ggseg.extra")
```

### Development version of freesurfer

The atlas creation functions require a development version of the freesurfer R package that is not yet on CRAN.
Until the [PR is merged](https://github.com/muschellij2/freesurfer/pull/28), install from:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pak::pak("drmowinckels/freesurfer@refactor")
```

## Create custom atlases
We have tutorials on how to make atlases available in the `Articles` of the [package documentation page](https://ggsegverse.github.io/ggseg.extra/). 
Currently, the pipeline for making 3d atlases needs FreeSurfer to be installed on your system and a ready `.annot` file to use for the conversions.
Improvements to the pipeline in creating cortical atlases both for ggseg and ggseg3d is still being developed.
Pipelines for creating sub-cortical atlases of any kind are still in their infancy, and we do not yet have good solutions for their creation. 
Suggestions for improvement are welcome through GH issues or direct Pull requests.

## Available atlases
There are currently `r nrow(atlases)` available atlases across `r length(unique(atlases$Package))` packages. 
The packages, their repository name and location can be found with:

```{r, echo = FALSE, results='asis'}
for (i in 1:nrow(atlases)) {
  atl <- as.character(atlases[i, "Package"])

  # find doi
  readmeurl <- sprintf(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggsegverse/%s/main/README.Rmd",
    atl
  )
  if (httr::http_error(readmeurl)) {
    readmeurl <- sprintf(
      "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggsegverse/%s/master/README.Rmd",
      atl
    )
  }

  readme <- readLines(readmeurl)
  idx <- grep("badges: ", readme)
  badges <- readme[(idx[1] + 1):(idx[2] - 1)]
  badges <- c(
    "",
    badges[c(grep("\\[!\\[R", badges), grep("\\[!\\[DOI", badges))]
  )

  cat(
    sprintf("### [%s](%s)", atl, atlases[i, "RemoteUrl"]),
    sprintf(
      '<img src="%s/raw/HEAD/man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="%s logo" width="120"/>',
      atlases[i, "RemoteUrl"],
      atl
    ),
    badges,
    sprintf("\n%s\n%s\n", atlases[i, "Title"], atlases[i, "Description"]),
    sep = "\n"
  )
}
```

## Code of Conduct

Please note that the ggseg.extra project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/0/0/code-of-conduct.html). By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

### Report bugs or requests  
Don't hesitate to ask for support using [github issues](https://github.com/ggsegverse/ggseg.extra/issues), or requesting new atlases. 
While we would love getting help in creating new atlases, you may also request atlases through the issues, and we will try to get to it.
