# Smooth and simplify atlas 2D contours

Topology-preserving simplification of atlas sf geometry via
[`rmapshaper::ms_simplify()`](http://andyteucher.ca/rmapshaper/reference/ms_simplify.md),
with optional smoothing layered on top to round off voxel-edge
stair-steps into smooth curves. Shared boundaries between adjacent
regions are simplified together, preventing gaps.

## Usage

``` r
atlas_smooth(
  atlas,
  smoothness = 0.4,
  labels = NULL,
  exclude = NULL,
  method = c("close", "chaikin", "ksmooth", "spline")
)
```

## Arguments

- atlas:

  A `ggseg_atlas` object with sf data.

- smoothness:

  Smoothing strength between 0 and 1. The scale is shared by every
  `method`, so the same value means a comparable amount of smoothing
  whichever one you pick; each method's native parameter is derived from
  it. Around 0.4–0.6, the default, rounds off voxel-edge stair-steps on
  millimetre voxel grids without distorting shapes; 1 is the most
  smoothing a method applies before shapes stop resembling their input.

- labels:

  Optional regex pattern. Only labels matching this pattern are
  smoothed; others are left unchanged.

- exclude:

  Optional regex pattern. Labels matching this pattern are left
  unchanged; all others are smoothed.

- method:

  Smoothing method. `"close"` (the default) is a morphological closing:
  a positive then negative
  [`sf::st_buffer()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/geos_unary.html).
  It rounds outlines but **fills holes narrower than the smoothing
  distance**, which erases the sulci of a thin cortical ribbon. The
  remaining methods come from
  [`smoothr::smooth()`](https://strimas.com/smoothr/reference/smooth.html)
  and move vertices rather than dilating the shape, so enclosed holes
  stay open: `"chaikin"` (corner cutting), `"ksmooth"` (kernel
  smoothing) and `"spline"`. Choose `"close"` to round solid shapes such
  as tract tubes, and one of the others when the geometry has holes
  worth keeping.

## Value

The `ggseg_atlas`, with its geometry rounded off.

## Details

Note that the default `method = "close"` fills holes narrower than
`smoothness`; see `method` for alternatives that preserve them.

By default all labels are smoothed equally. Use `labels` to smooth only
matching labels, or `exclude` to smooth everything except matching
labels. Only one of `labels` or `exclude` may be specified.

[`atlas_simplify()`](https://ggsegverse.github.io/ggseg.extra/reference/atlas_simplify.md)
to reduce the vertex count, and
[`atlas_dilate()`](https://ggsegverse.github.io/ggseg.extra/reference/atlas_dilate.md)
to grow or shrink regions. Each does one thing: how round a shape is,
how many vertices it costs, and how big it is, are separate questions
and get tuned at separate times. Simplify before smoothing, not after -
dropping vertices from a rounded outline replaces its curves with
straight chords, putting the stair-step back.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# Round off the voxel staircase.
atlas <- atlas_smooth(my_atlas, smoothness = 0.4)

# Leave the brain outline alone.
atlas <- atlas_smooth(my_atlas, smoothness = 0.4, exclude = "^cortex")

# Round a cortical ribbon without closing its sulci.
atlas <- atlas_smooth(
  my_atlas,
  smoothness = 0.4,
  method = "chaikin",
  labels = "^cortex"
)
} # }
```
