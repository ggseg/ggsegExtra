# ggsegExtra: Extra Utilities for the 'ggseg' and 'ggseg3d' Plotting Tools

Contains functions to create new data sets compatible with the 'ggseg'
and 'ggseg3d' packages for plotting brain segmentations through R.
Requires several external software to be installed on the system for
atlas creations to work, and most of these are not available for
windows. But atlas creation tools exist for 2d simple features data, and
also 3d tri-surface mesh plots. Also has a list of compatible data sets
and functions for easy installation of these.
