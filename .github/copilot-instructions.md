### Quick orientation — what this repo is

- This is an R package that provides atlas creation pipelines and
  datasets for the `ggseg` / `ggseg3d` plotting ecosystem. See
  `DESCRIPTION` for package dependencies and system requirements
  (notably: FreeSurfer, GDAL, ImageMagick, orca). The user-facing
  documentation and tutorials live in `vignettes/` and `docs/`.

### Big-picture architecture

- Core R code lives in `R/` (e.g. `R/create-ggseg-atlas.R`,
  `R/create-ggseg3d-atlas.R`). These files implement multi-step
  pipelines that operate on disk (image snapshots, masks, interim
  files) and return `brain_atlas` objects used by `ggseg`.
- Data and generated surfaces are under `inst/` and `data-raw/`.
- Documentation is generated with `pkgdown` into `docs/` (see
  `_pkgdown.yml`). CI builds and renders on macOS (see
  `.github/workflows/*.yaml`).

### Important conventions & patterns an AI should follow

- Pipeline steps: many functions accept a `steps` numeric vector
  (e.g. `steps = 1:7` in `make_ggseg3d_2_ggseg`) and write files to
  an `output_dir`. Do not assume in-memory-only flows — these
  functions read/write many intermediate files.
- Atlas naming: ggseg3d atlases often use `_3d` suffixes and
  palettes are created with `make_palette_ggseg()` (see
  `R/create-ggseg-atlas.R`). When generating atlases, ensure names
  and palette keys match repository conventions (see usage of
  `brain_atlas()` in the R code).
- External binaries: functions call system tools (ImageMagick,
  GDAL, FreeSurfer, orca). Guard changes that call or parse their
  outputs and add clear error messages if binaries are missing. See
  `DESCRIPTION` SystemRequirements and checks such as `check_magick()`
  and `check_fs()` present in the code.
- Reporting/progress: code uses `cli`, `progressr` and verbose text
  output. Preserve this behaviour in edits (use `cli::cli_*` and
  `progressr::progress()` patterns).

### Developer workflows (how to build / test / debug)

- Install dependencies (match CI): prefer `remotes::install_deps(dependencies=TRUE)`
  or use `pak::local_install()` as in `pkgdown.yaml`.
- Local checks / tests:
  - Run R CMD check: `R CMD check .` or via `devtools::check()`.
  - Run tests: `devtools::test()` or `Rscript -e 'testthat::test_dir("tests/testthat")'`.
  - CI runs on macOS and installs system deps via `brew` (see
    `.github/workflows/*`). If a change touches code depending on
    GDAL/ImageMagick/FreeSurfer/orca, run tests on macOS or a matching
    environment.
- Documentation and pkgdown: docs are published with
  `pkgdown::deploy_to_branch()` in CI (`.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml`).

### Files to read first when editing or creating features

- `DESCRIPTION` — package dependencies & SystemRequirements
- `inst/surfaces/` and `data-raw/` — examples and raw assets used by
  pipelines
- `_pkgdown.yml`, `vignettes/`, — examples and tutorials to
  mirror for usage patterns and function signatures
- `.github/workflows/*.yaml` — CI setup; useful for reproducing
  environment & install order

### Integration points & gotchas

- Many real runs require external tools not available on Linux CI by
  default — CI forks install them via Homebrew on macOS. Running the
  pipeline on other OS may fail unless those tools are present.
- Code uses `terra`, and `sf` — watch for platform
  specific binary issues and prefer high-level R APIs when possible.
- Intermediate files have expected directory layout (e.g.
  `output_dir/<atlas>/{img,regions,masks}`). If you change file
  naming, update all downstream readers (contour extraction,
  smoothing, vertex reduction).

### Example edits the agent can safely make

- Small refactors inside `R/` that preserve the step pipeline
  signatures (`steps`, `output_dir`, `cleanup`) and retain CLI
  messages and progress reporting.
- Add unit tests under `tests/testthat/` that run quickly and mock
  external binaries where possible. Prefer to test pure-R logic (e.g.
  coordinate transforms, palette creation `make_palette_ggseg()`),
  and add `skip_on_ci()` when tests require heavy system tools.

### When to ask for human help

- Any change that modifies on-disk file naming, image formats, or
  calls to external binaries (ImageMagick, GDAL, FreeSurfer, orca)
  should get a human review and a short compatibility test on macOS.
- Any large refactor of atlas-building pipelines that changes
  function signatures or the atlas object structure.


### Updating NEWS.md

only add information that is relevant for the R-package to NEWS.md. 
Any other changes related to workflows, pkgdown etc are not relevant to the R-package releases and thus dont shouldnt be listed in NEWS.

Organise NEWS by user-facing and developer facing changes, and headings for minor vs breaking changes.
