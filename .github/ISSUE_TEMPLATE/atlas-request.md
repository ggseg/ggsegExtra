**Please see information online on making your own atlas**
Please first consider if you can create the atlas your self and contribute it, rather than have other make it. We all have limited time and there are _many_ atlases out there. Any community contributed atlas is very much appreciated. See the [online documentation](https://ggseg.github.io/ggsegExtra/articles/createdkt.html) for examples

**Describe which atlas you want created**
Please provide information on the paper the atlas comes from (please provide a link) and what type of atlas it is (cortical, subcortical, white matter, tracts etc).

**annot/cifti templates**
If you already have annotation or other atlas template files, please provide these as it will enable us to start creating the atlas faster.
